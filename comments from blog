Brilliant movie. Shows once again that all reality (social and political) is manipulated by and for the benefit of the powerful. The ending came as a total surprise – with the spiritual message of unity and oneness. A must-see movie. Thanks for sharing.

I picked up the book “The Catcher in the Rye” last week and finished reading through it the day J.D. Salinger left us. What a coincidence!
I have the same regrets as you do about not having read the book in my teens. However, for the kind of character that I was back in those days, I doubt I’d have understood the depth of it then, had I managed to read through it completely in the first place, that is. So, I am not surprised that your teenaged son abandoned it half way through.
We can all identify with Holden Caulfield at some point or another. And, in some way or another (and I hate to admit it), I believe we can also identify with at least one of the other characters in the book. Though most people grumble about the system, I guess when it’s decision-making time, most of us walk the path that’s well-trodden. Isn’t it easier to succumb to the pressures of the society?
BTW, I heard it somewhere (haven’t verified it though) that a school teacher who tried to recommend this book to her pupils got the ax. C’est la vie!

Hey, this was hilarious!! I loved it and laughed so much. I am not at all surprised by your great sense of humour. You have always had it – satire – in leaps and bounds! I wish you would write in this vein more often. Will give you more things to do than just playing Solitaire!!

Well and appropriately said Shaukat….what could be better than love, you wont find it when you go looking for it ….for the Sufis Love and God are synonyms and their yearning for this through music and poetry gets the mullahs goatee …I loved this part!

You have summarized her so well in both your story and poetry. Just Beautiful!! Story tells her life – organic, simple and conventional. I hope she was as peaceful as you say.
Poem liberates (hopefully) your grief and clearly shows your love for her.
You will find peace in her kids…

This sounds so fun. We all have gone through the phase of trying to impress the opposite sex. Now if we look back, it seems so embarrassing.

Love it! This brings back sweet old memories. Our eid kicked off with friends going shopping for shalwar kameez, jewelry, and shoes. Shoes had to be high heels no matter how hard and tiresome it would be walk in them, lol. Then came hairstyle and makeup. All to look pretty and of course to impress boys.

Zehra Mam,
I’m an 18 year old Teen born in a Dawoodi Bohra Family, but today I identify myself as a Non-Denominational Muslim!!
I am opposed to any kind of Misinterpretation of Islam & am a staunch believer of Unity in the Islamic Ummah (among Shia & Sunnis). I’ve been to Sunni & Tabligi Mosques as well.
There’s always a voice I hear in me which asks me to Revolt & show people the True Islam, the Islam which asks us to unite under the Banner of Islam without any sects (Sunni, Shia, Tablig) & asks us to lead a Simple Life in duty of Goodness!!
I’m a staunch supporter of “Freedom of Speech” & I also oppose anyone who tries to silent anyone’s basic Right of Freedom of Speech (including yours)
Even I’m opposed to the Orthodox Bohri view that “We are Bohris (& not Shia or Sunnis) & Syedna is the one who’ll lead us to Jannah”. According to me, Syedna is merely a Leader & a normal human being like us who would/could/should make mistakes, like we do & his only responsibilty is to preach, preach Islam & the Prophets Sunnah.
But I’ve read many of your articles where you use language which isn’t legitimate & opposes many of Islamic Principles as well. Sometime it seems like you’re wrongly Criticising Islam & bringing Islam into it (while its just a Cultural issue).
I would even like to point out the way you’ve been Revolting. You’re taking this problems & sharing it with Non-Muslims, which in turn would only degrade peoples view on the Great Religion of Islam. I also believe that Muslims & only we Muslims have the right/power to change any wrongdoings of our community because of the misinterpretation of Islam & Quran.
I would like to request you to not make it an issue of Islam vs. State but an issue of Cultural Evil within us Muslims(which it rightly is)
I’m also attaching my email, if you don’t mind discussing this Topic

You may also find me on Quora
