      <p><em>Keepers of the Faith</em> is set among the members of a small Muslim sect of India, ruled by an oppressive priesthood that demands absolute submission, while overseeing regressive customs such as wearing the veil, isolating widows, and female circumcision. When a section of the community rebels, the head priest's wrath comes crashing down upon them. In their excommunication, they are shunned by friends and family and denied religious rites such as burials. A peaceful community is split into two.</p>      
      <p>The novel follows the fates of two teenage lovers who find themselves on opposite sides of the schism. Their dream of a happy life together is shattered and they are forced into separate destinies. Years later, as family man and woman their paths cross again, presenting them with soul-destroying choices.</p>
      <p>This is the story of a people caught in the grip of blind faith and the terrible price they must pay for standing up for their dignity. Told with compassion and a controlled rage, the story takes the reader on a journey that is as provocative as it is heart-wrenching.</p>

    <h2>Praise for Keepers of the Faith</h2>
      <p>Ajmeriâ€™s <em>Keepers of the Faith</em> is a breathtaking and brave story about the tyranny of religion, a community at odds with itself and the bonds of love that endure despite oppression. This book is complex, beautiful, and essential reading for our times.</p>
