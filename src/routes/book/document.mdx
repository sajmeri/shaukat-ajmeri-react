  <h2>Excerpt</h2>

  <p>For the wedding Shabbir flew down to India on a two-week vacation and met Rukhsana twice before they tied the knot. His family had been invited to Rukhsana’s house for the “threshold climbing” ceremony – when the boy formally enters the girl’s house for the first time. He came with a battalion of friends all dressed in community attire. He was a tall, baby-faced young man with a ready smile and serious eyes. He wore his cap slightly pushed back and the widow’s peak peeked through. He carried himself with poise and there was something about him that seemed to declare that he had figured it all out. Rukhsana found him cute but for his beard, which was black and lustrous and untamed. She tried to imagine him without it. That day they hardly got to talk; they only managed to exchange a few glances amid the general chatter and the fawning the guests received. It was incumbent upon the girl’s side to pamper the boy’s family, and especially his friends. Qamar, wanting to do the best, had catered food from the most expensive chef, sweets were ordered from Bombay, and Shabbir was given a gift package neatly wrapped in cellophane and tied with a crimson ribbon that finished with a dainty bow. </p>

<p>The package contained Japanese cloth for a three-piece suit, a flashy wristwatch, a bespoke skullcap with elaborate golden threadwork, a pair of merino wool socks, a muslin handkerchief, a tasbih with sandalwood beads, and a framed photograph of Mowlana. The “American” boy, scion of a wealthy man loaded with Kuwaiti petro-dollars, deserved nothing less. Rehana had spent hours neatly packing the gift, making sure that all the items were not only visible but also secure and the package sturdy enough to survive the scrutiny it would receive from everybody present. Since it contained Mowlana’s photo, it would be kissed reverentially and passed respectfully from hand to hand as though it were the Holy Book itself. </p>
<p>The guests left in the late afternoon, satiated and dulled by the rich and plentiful food they had consumed. When Zubaida found a moment alone with Rukhsana, she asked her what she thought of Shabbir. Rukhsana said nothing. As long as she lived under her father’s roof and authority, she had told herself, she would accept everything without complaining. Shabbir did not seem a bad sort. But who could tell what was inside a man’s heart? And mind? What demons animated his life? When she knew him better, perhaps she’d be able to negotiate her freedom and space. Thinking about this prospect filled her with a mellow dread. So much unfamiliar territory, so much emotional effort required to map out one’s place in it. With Akbar everything was familiar, charted out. Her heart ached in anguish. 
Back in her room to rest, she sat down at the dresser and regarded her reflection pensively in the mirror. She was wearing lehnga and odhni specially tailored for the occasion. The odhni slipped from her head as she leaned forward to examine a zit on her chin. The gold jewellery — the classical jhumka earrings and matching necklace and ring — were family heirlooms. The sun peeking through the parting in the curtains picked up a facet of the garnet in her necklace. Her beauty shone in that transient scintilla of light. Her long black hair was done in a rope braid, held with a fancy hairpin at the nape. </p>
<p>“You look lovely, aapa,” Rehana said, coming in. “What has that guy done to deserve you?” Rukhsana looked at her sister and smiled the saddest smile.</p>

    <h3>Powerful tale of love fraught with societal distress</h3>
    <p className={styles.byline}>by Razia Sanwari</p>
    <p>When religious dogmas and rituals pervade a man’s personal life and go on to completely suppress it, love and emotions get pushed into submission leading to heartbreak and unhappiness. Shaukat Ajmeri’s debut novel Keepers of the Faith is a story of such suppression and suffocation which can have only one consequence - emotional trauma that threatens to destroy lives! Based in Udaipur of the 1970s, the story revolves around the story of two teenagers Akbar and Rukhsana who belong to a Shia Muslim community and are madly in love with each other.</p>
    <details>
    <summary>More...</summary>
    <p>The two are able to steal beautiful moments of togetherness despite living in a closed neighbourhood till disaster strikes in the name of social boycott after a split in the community following a local election. Resentment, which had been brewing in the community for some time against the unreasonable diktats of the religious head, comes to the forefront and all hell breaks loose. </p>
<p>Akbar and Rukhsana find themselves in opposing groups and before they can overcome their bewilderment at the happenings around, they are torn apart by the two families. A heartbroken Akbar moves out to Mumbai to pursue a career in journalism while Rukhsana goes on to marry a blind follower of the priesthood and shifts to the US. Years later their paths cross again under different circumstances. Everything has changed for the two, yet a chance meeting rekindles the old fire within the two hearts threatening to destroy what they had carefully and painfully preserved over the years. </p>
<p> Keepers of the Faith is not a mere tale of two lovers. It is a story of the underlying pain and social trauma that result from an oppressive religious clergy which ruthlessly destroys everything that stands in its way. The novel describes how a community steeped in blind faith can be manipulated to fulfill selfish motives regardless of the consequences and emotional casualties. It speaks of exploitation, blackmail, fear, wrecked families and broken hearts.</p>
<p>Ajmeri does a wonderful job in highlighting the emotional angle of a rebellion which has fraught the community of Udaipur for the past five decades. Such a take on the movement - which has so far seen documentaries, chronicles and documentation of facts - is the first of its kind. The writer uses the rebellion in Udaipur to spin his tale of love. And he does this with an amazing skill which stirs the very soul of the reader leaving her teary eyed and shaken.

<h3>A novel with an almost immediate relevance</h3>
    <p className={styles.byline}>by Farhat Hasan</p>
    <p>Shaukat Ajmeri’s novel, <i>The Keepers of Faith</i> is a sensitive and a heart-wrenching portrayal of the tribulations of a shi’ite religious community in Rajasthan in India. Even as the novel is about the Momin community, the point it makes is equally relevant to all religions and sects in contemporary South Asia; and that point is that it is always a formidable challenge to speak for religious reforms, and stand for a rational evaluation of religious beliefs and practice.</p>
    <details>
    <summary>More...</summary>
    <p>The work highlights the suffocating influence of the conservative religious leaders, and how their control over the community thwarts initiatives towards reform, and blunts appeals to rationality and critical re-evaluation of entrenched rituals. In this respect, the book draws attention to the pervading influence of the obscurantist forces, and the extent to which they inhibit the impulses towards modernity and change among communities in India. At the same time, the novel also celebrates the resistance of the educated and inspired members within the community, particularly women, against religious orthodoxy, for even when they, and their families suffer social ostracism, they still persist in pushing for change. </p>
<p>As a work of fiction, the work has a didactic edge, and pushes for the repudiation of orthodox and obscurantist practice among all religious communities in India. It makes a strong case for the need to embrace modern values and rationality in the articulation of faith, but for any community to do so, it needs to be vigilant of its leaders, and prevent the maulvis and the pundits from controlling and disciplining its members. In today’s India, when rationalists have been brutally murdered for their positions, and those who speak for reforms and critique entrenched belief are vilified and abused, the message in the novel has an almost immediate relevance.</p>
