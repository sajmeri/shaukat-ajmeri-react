From their origins in Yemen they have over the generations made important contributions to Ismaili thought and literature. Sumaiyaâ€™s father, the late Abbas Hamdani, was a scholar of Ismaili history and in particular of a volume of the philosophical work the Rasa'il-e-Ikhwan al-Safa (Epistles of Brethren of Purity).
