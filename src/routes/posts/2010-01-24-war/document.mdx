<p>It was February 15, 2003. In Toronto it was freezing cold. But the world was running a high fever of protest against the impending U.S. attack on Iraq. These were heady times, hundreds of thousands of people around the world poured out into the streets with one voice, one intention: to stop the war. It was as if the whole humanity had become one creature, speaking with one conscience. How could one not to feel the pulse of the zeitgeist, not to be part of this collective heartbeat?<span id="more-364"></span></p>
<p>We too, the whole family, went downtown to join the protest march. The previous night we hurriedly put together a couple of posters with catchy slogans. In the morning, we bundled up, crammed the posters in the boot of the car and headed downtown. We parked the car at a distance and walked to the square where the march was to start from. It was cold like hell and our breath seemed to freeze in midair and I wondered whether it was a good idea to venture out in this arctic weather &#8211; with the family, with little kids.</p>
<p>But we were not alone. There were tens of other families with little kids. We thought we were doing it for them, to safeguard their future and our world from the depredations of an empire gone mad. We knew the U.S. was invading Iraq for its oil. The pretexts were many and justifications many more. But nobody was fooled. The high point of selling this fraudulent war to the world was Powell&#8217;s ridiculous presentation to the UN General Assembly. How good men can be enlisted to do bad things!</p>

<span class="caption">Protest against the war in downdon Toronto: Was it all in vain?</span></div>
<p>One can make a case for a just war. But if there was ever an unjust war it was this. Come to think of it, this is the goddamn 21st century, not some dark ages of barbaric tribal warfare. We have an international rule of law, a Western Civilisation that never stops crowing about itself, an evolved human race with mind-boggling achievements in art, science and culture. But suddenly, at that point in our benighted times, it seemed as if none of it mattered. One superpower drunk with power and hubris was bent upon destroying our history, our dignity.</p>
<p>And it did. With aplomb and with impunity. Seven years on, millions dead and a country devastated, the madness continues. In retrospect, all those fevered days of protests look surreal, even ridiculously naive. But what else could have we done? The world agitated and churned in desperation, the dis-empowered consumers for once tried to become citizens. For that brief moment we held out a hope that at last people&#8217;s will be done. But that was not to be.</p>
<p>What followed was shock and awe, and the world watched on with impotent anger and disbelief. The following are the words I wrote in helpless rage. They do not matter much today, except to refresh our memory and mock our innocence. Here goes&#8230;</p>
<h4>Full spectrum madness</h4>
<p><strong>An Empire out of control</strong></p>
<p>Is there no one to stop this madness?<br />
NO ONE?</p>
<p>we tried, millions and millions<br />
around the world<br />
but failed<br />
we protested, we prayed<br />
but to no avail</p>
<p>these hollow men<br />
armed with &#8216;vile maxim&#8217;<br />
drunk with power<br />
dreaming of &#8216;avarice beyond dream&#8217;<br />
with hubris in their heart<br />
mammon on their mind<br />
will stop at nothing<br />
NOTHING</p>
<p>no reason, no rhyme<br />
will stop them<br />
no god, no faith<br />
will stop them</p>
<p>they speak in democracy&#8217;s name<br />
but ignore peoples&#8217; cries<br />
they speak in truth&#8217;s name<br />
but utter nothing save lies<br />
LIES<br />
they talk of liberty<br />
but snare minds in chains<br />
talk of peace, but wage war</p>
<p>high hypocrisy, low cunning<br />
what shock, what awe<br />
the like of which<br />
Orwell and Swift, Twain<br />
and Thoreau never saw</p>
<p>these hollow men<br />
are not stupid<br />
nor are they mad<br />
working on a grand plan<br />
nursing, nourishing a vision<br />
they want a finger in every pie<br />
a jackboot on every land</p>
<p>for centuries they&#8217;ve conquered<br />
foreign lands and made their own<br />
destroying culture, life, memory<br />
in their wake</p>
<p>today they march again,<br />
bomb again, mutilate again<br />
without a care for life or law</p>
<p>that thousands of children<br />
have died already is not enough<br />
that depleted uranium is mutating<br />
babies already is not enough<br />
that the country is starved<br />
and strafed already is not enough<br />
the Empire now must<br />
kill them to save them<br />
as if Vietnam never happened</p>
<p>these hollow men<br />
talk of morality and rights<br />
while making mockery of both<br />
swear by resolutions<br />
while having vetoed most</p>
<p>weapons of mass destruction<br />
is the new mantra<br />
WMD WMD WMD<br />
here&#8217;s a preamble to<br />
the new tantra</p>
<p>who has the largest stockpile of WMD<br />
biological, chemical, nuclear?<br />
USA</p>
<p>who has used WMD wantonly<br />
with intent clear?<br />
USA</p>
<p>who is the only one who has used<br />
the A-Bomb not once but twice?<br />
USA</p>
<p>who is making the most noise<br />
shrill and sanctimonious?<br />
USA</p>
<p>who should disarm and destroy WMD?<br />
IRAQ</p>
<p>Hark. Bark. Laugh.</p>
<p>what civilization is this<br />
that doesn&#8217;t die laughing<br />
in face of such absurdity<br />
what progress is this<br />
that has gagged your voice<br />
amid media unreality<br />
what age is this<br />
that worships still at the altar<br />
of high and mighty</p>
<p>these hollow men<br />
come into power and pelf<br />
by hook and mostly by crook<br />
they wangle your vote<br />
strangle your voice<br />
they give you liberties<br />
that matter not<br />
then rule over life and death<br />
our life and death</p>
<p>cheer cheer for gift of life<br />
life crushed by<br />
routine work, endless debt<br />
slave away for the American Dream<br />
earn spend, spend earn<br />
in two words is end of life<br />
that&#8217;s what the masters want<br />
and that&#8217;s how you must behave</p>
<p>blood and sweat oil the system,<br />
every minion, every satrap<br />
in oil&#8217;s thrall<br />
nature under the thumb<br />
time to conquer men and all<br />
to appease SUVs, heat<br />
huge homes and granite hearts</p>
<p>time to feed fires of profit<br />
with mindless slaughter<br />
time to assault truth<br />
with official blather<br />
time to pacify demons<br />
of the new world order</p>
<p>welcome to the<br />
New American Century<br />
age of unchallenged power<br />
chilling arrogance<br />
age of stifled hopes<br />
unleavened nightmares<br />
age of congealed imagination<br />
slumbering outrage<br />
age of &#8216;either you&#8217;re with us<br />
or with them&#8217;</p>
<p>Empires have risen and<br />
fallen before<br />
this Empire too will<br />
bite the dust<br />
but not before the world<br />
has gone bust<br />
not before blood is spilt<br />
for power lust<br />
not before gods are buried<br />
under earthy crust</p>
<p>9/11 came out of the blue<br />
a godsend, a manna from heaven<br />
a neo-con dream come true<br />
a sun of black fears rises anew<br />
a pretext for endless war 24/7</p>
<p>a<br />
war of the rich against the poor<br />
war of the powerful against the weak<br />
war of the smug against the unsure<br />
war of the conceited against the meek</p>
<p>regime change is back in fashion<br />
rulers will be made and unmade<br />
at mere fancy and whim<br />
Yesterday Afghanistan<br />
Today Iraq<br />
Tomorrow your country and mine</p>
<p>it had come to this<br />
WHY?<br />
how could centuries of wisdom<br />
flowering of intellect and grace<br />
quest for beauty and elegance<br />
achievements good and great<br />
come to this?<br />
this apocalypse?<br />
this moment of truth<br />
terrible, tragic?</p>
<p>what is this truth that<br />
holds such sway?<br />
that profit, greed, power<br />
have won the day?<br />
that finest of human values<br />
have turned to clay?</p>
<p>for how long will flawed<br />
humans stumble and fall?<br />
for how long will cruel<br />
gods delight in our folly and gall?</p>
