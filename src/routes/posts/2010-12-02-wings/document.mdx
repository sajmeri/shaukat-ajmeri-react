<p>Why would one write poetry, I don’t know. Why would one write anything at all, I don’t know. This much I know that we humans are a creative bunch. We create things, invent things. We just can&#8217;t help it. Without this innate, ancient urge to create I wonder where would we be today. But then, with the creative yin comes the destructive yang. Our amazing creative talent is balanced by our instinct for awful destruction. Between these two opposites, this duality, resides the secret of our visible universe. <span id="more-998"></span></p>
<p>But I digress. Here is a poem &#8211; rather an expression of random thoughts and images that have been playing on my mind for the past few days. I&#8217;ve attempted to give them a coherent shape, or so I would like to think. Here goes&#8230; </p>
<h3>On the wings of hope</h3>
<p>Round and round the heavens swirl<br />
Spreading marvels in countless hues<br />
The heart cries a silent sob<br />
Of wonder, of terror, of awe<br />
At the utter beauty of this night<br />
Oh to be alive, to be human<br />
To breathe a breath that comes<br />
From the darkness of time<br />
Bearing bouquets of love and pain<br />
Of failed hopes, of endless seeking<br />
Oh the tyranny of the unknown</p>
<p>To ancient rhythms the heart still beats<br />
To what end no one knows<br />
A nameless love lingers<br />
In the shadows of everyday life<br />
When everything is said and done<br />
Emptiness remains<br />
Prisoner to words and meanings<br />
On this day of Sabbath<br />
Free spirits have lost their minds<br />
Come, bring your gods along<br />
Let’s drink to their eternity and<br />
Snatch the secrets from their hearts<br />
Then in the circus of unreason<br />
Religion will be the clown<br />
But don’t be too quick to laugh<br />
New messiahs wait in the wings</p>
<p>Meet me beneath the scented cedars<br />
By the pond where lotuses grow<br />
We’ll walk on a path to nowhere<br />
Away from the straight and narrow<br />
In the symphony of distant stars<br />
Under a low hanging moon<br />
We&#8217;ll dance like mad lovers<br />
To the music of our souls<br />
You and me, me and you<br />
Whirling, turning, merging<br />
Into one body, one being<br />
Here, on the threshold of<br />
Sacred and profane we’ll<br />
Un-name all that is named<br />
One by one, thing by thing<br />
Unlock the mysteries and<br />
Free the Word from the Book<br />
And rescue meaning from<br />
Prophets and priests</p>
<p>When the music stops and feet are tired<br />
We’ll rest under a nameless sky<br />
Among the ruins of shattered certainties<br />
Caressed by the slanting rays of a moist dawn<br />
We’ll close our eyes in silent gratitude and<br />
Fly prayers on the wings of hope</p>
