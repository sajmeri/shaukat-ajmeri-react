<p>He sat on the edge of the bed beside <em>maasi</em>, a heart-broken old woman. Unshaven and unkempt, he was in pajama-kurta and a skull cap that Bohras wear. He was hugging his one leg which was raised, bent at the knee, and was leaning back a bit. He spoke in a voice that came as if from a deep well of sorrow, rasping and laced with pathos. You felt a certain attraction (or is it empathy?) for his posture, his voice, his simplicity. <span id="more-1088"></span></p>
<p>For a fleeting moment you felt like hugging him. You struggled to find words to comfort him. But it is he who had come to comfort us. He spoke in simple words, and wept silently as he spoke. “Who can understand the sorrow one feels in one’s heart,” he said. The poignancy of those words could have melted a stone. You were sitting on the floor, close to him, trying to catch the warmth of the weak winter sun which was streaming through the door. You too shed a tear as you sat there listening to him, soaking in the sun and the wisdom of his words.</p>
<p>How loss can unite even as it creates deep void within. And words feel so inadequate. Beyond platitudes what really can one say? But he said so much without saying much. He was never known for his eloquence. Or for anything else, for that matter. He worked in a government job and is now probably retired. He has lived a conventional life, simple and ordinary. He is a man of God. Perhaps that’s what God intended humans to be: humble, meek and withdrawn. Completely at peace with himself and the world, he&#8217;s not a seeker. He seems to know the truth. He has never missed a prayer. At an age when other young men were chasing girls, he was spending his evenings at a <em>dargah</em> sweeping the marble floors.</p>
<p>Every evening you would find him there doing his chores, totally absorbed, and unmindful of the constant traffic of devotees. People would come and kiss the tombstones and were done with it. But his devotion demanded more. He would keep the place clean, dust and re-arrange the <em>gilaf</em> of all the tombstones. And when he did <em>ziyarat</em> it was not just a mechanical act but a deliberate, slow routine. He would reach under the <em>gilaf</em> and caress the bare marble with his hands and then rub his hands on his face as if transferring the divinity from the sacred stone to human flesh. When he was done, he would sit in a corner and read the <em>yasin</em> for hours on end.</p>
<p>Then, you found him weird. Life had so much to offer, it was yours to be lived and be made success of. Why waste it sweeping floors? You were young and arrogant, drunk on reason and scientific temper. You had no capacity to understand a dimension of reality that lay beyond the physical and beyond the visible. Today you think you know better, success and rationality you so prided in did not measure up after all. All things material do not amount to much, you realise. This is a truth that cannot be taught. It just dawns on you, if you’re lucky. That day, as you sat with him sharing common loss, you could appreciate his simple faith. A lifetime of ardent devotion had a meaning, a spiritual logic that cannot be explained. He and you were separated by worlds but you knew, that unlike you, he was in touch with his inner universe. Wisdom does not come from mere workings of the mind. From dry intellect.</p>
<p>Looking out to the door you saw dust particles floating in the shaft of light. How was this life, this planet different from those tiny specks in the air? Wasn&#8217;t it all mere cosmic dust? Fragile, fleeting, insignificant. And we make such a production of it.</p>

<h3>When I think of you&#8230;</h3>
<p>When I think of you how can<br />
I keep my heart from breaking<br />
This Neem tree, this shade, this sun<br />
This silence left behind by a life<br />
This desolation that has settled<br />
Like a rock deep in the heart<br />
Cold morning air hangs heavy with<br />
Moisture of raw, melting grief<br />
How much can one cry, yet behind<br />
Dry eyes I hold back a river<br />
Rose petals adorn your bed like<br />
A thousand sweet-smelling regrets<br />
You sleep well, I’ll sit here and<br />
Wait and watch over your dreams<br />
They say it’s time for closure but<br />
Where do I bury your memories<br />
Day by day, sigh by sigh you had<br />
Stolen smiles from a tight-fisted life<br />
The winter chills you so dreaded<br />
Now run down my spine<br />
Your lifetime of love and longings<br />
Tied in neat bundles now sit<br />
Orphaned behind locked cupboards<br />
It was a simple life, ordinary life<br />
Why is it that those who have<br />
Not much to begin with<br />
Have so much to lose<br />
When I think of you how can<br />
I keep my heart from breaking</p>
