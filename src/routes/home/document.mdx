        <p><em>Keepers of the Faith</em> will be published in April 2020. The book tells the story of a people caught in the grip of blind faith and the terrible price they must pay for standing up for their dignity. Told with compassion and a controlled rage, the story takes the reader on a journey that is as provocative as it is heart-wrenching.   <a href="/book">Read more </a>
